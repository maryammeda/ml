    "Before diving into Mutual Information, let's understand the problem it solves. We often want to know which variables in our data are most related to the thing we want to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Feature selection is the process of identifying the most useful variables in a dataset to predict an outcome.\n",
    "* R-squared measures the relationship between two continuous variables but doesn't apply to categorical data. Mutual Information, however, can quantify relationships between any variable types, categorical or continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutual Information\n",
    "A numeric value that measures the dependence or relationship between two variables. It tells you how much information you gain about one variable by observing another.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A mutual information score of 0 means the variables are completely independent. Knowing one tells you nothing about the other.\n",
    "* A higher mutual information score means the variables are more dependent. Knowing one tells you a lot about the other.\n",
    "* Crucially, it works with both discrete and continuous variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Joint Probability** - the probability of two or more things happening at the same time. In the video's example, its the probability that someone both **Likes Popcorn** AND **Loves Troll 2**\n",
    "* You canculate it directly from you data by counting how many times both conditions are met and dividing by the total number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    " `p(A and B) = (Number of times A and B both happen) / (Total Observations)`\n"
